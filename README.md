# gravy
A C++ utility library laid out in a similar manner as the C# standard library.

# Features
- Methods for string manipulation
- Utilities for converting from/to binary and binary serialization
- File and directory handling
- Resource packing (virtual file system)
- Sockets for listening or connecting to servers
- Http client
- Etc...

# Disclaimer
Don't use this library if you have high expectations. There are other libraries that have more features and are better maintained. I mainly made this library for my own use but I am happy to share it with anyone who is interested.

# Dependencies
- C++ 17 or newer
- OpenSSL (optional)

# Building
I develop on Linux but I try my best to make this library compatible with Windows and Mac. However, I do not have the means to test on all platforms so you're on your own if you want to build for anything other than Linux.
